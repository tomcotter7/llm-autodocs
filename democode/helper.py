    This function takes a string of text, and a voice selection as inputs. It then uses Google's Text-to-Speech client to synthesize the text into speech, formatting the audio file as an MP3. The voice for the speech is chosen based on the input voice selection, with the gender being neutral and the language code being 'en-GB'.

    Returns:
 
     
    A response from Google's Text-To-Speech API which contains the synthesized speech audio file.
